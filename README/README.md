!SNA Bespoke Carpentry

Welcome,

This website is the official website for SNA Bespoke Carpentry who are a contruction company in west london. I am a founder of this company along with a friend of mine. The aim of this website is to show potential customers who SNA Carpentry are, what they can do, and to advertise the company as the builders the customer should chose for their next project. This has been done by including images on every page that shows different stages of different jobs that have been completed by workers of SNA Bespoke Carpentry. The target audience is homeowners, whatever the age or gender.

#Features

##All Pages
###Header:
-In the header I have included a simple Logo of the company name that links back to the home page. This also introduces the color scheme for the website as a whole.
-I have also included navigation with icons and writting to easily navigate between the different pages. On smaller screens the writing in not visible and instead there is a title of the page you are currently on, but the icons also remain.

###Footer:
-On the left side of the footer is the links to the social networks denotted with icons. This includes Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and a link that opens the user's default E-mail app with the companies E-mail address already inserted. This makes it very easy to find any of the social links the user might want.
-In the center of the footer are two images of the certifications the company is certified with to show the user that the company is trusted in these aspects. In this instance we have included DBS for working with children and vulnerable adults, and a level 3 first aid course.
-On the right hand side is the contact information with the address, phone number and e-mail of the company. This is to make it easy to find any contact information the user might need.

All of the features in the header and footer are places where the user might expect so as to make the website predictable for the user and thus easy to use.

##Home page:
The home page layout is designed so its clear what each section is for. This makes the website quicker and easier to use for the user as it's easy for them to decide where to go depending on the part of the website they wish to use,

###Welcome image.
-The welcome image is in place to show the user a project that the company has completed. This not only acts as an example of some work that is underway but not completed, but also indicated to the user, amongst other things, what the website is made for.
-The 'Get a Quote' button on the left is there as one of the first things the user can see when they open the website, so that if someone is just on the website to get a quote, it's immediately clear where to click to get where they need to.
-The 'Visit our Gallery' button on the right is to bring the user to the gallery. This is so if the user doesn't want to read the introduction, and they have just come to the website to view the images, they can get there easily.

###Introduction.
-The writing in the introduction section is made of 3 headers and paragraphs to give a short introduction into who SNA Bespoke Carpentry is and what they do.
-The image next to the introduction is to show another example of some work the company has completed.

###Second image.
The seconds landscape image is to show the same roof as the first image, but from further away, and the effect of the page scrolling past is to make the webpage a little more interesting when scrolling.

##Our Services
The our services page is so the user can see clear lists of work that can be completed. This is so the user can ensure that the company is able to complete the service they require.

###Landscape Image.
The landscape image is used to give the page a bit of life, so it's not just some text on the screen.

###Text boxes.
The text boxes are used to contain the lists of what services are offered by the company, or services they can organise.

###Media in line with text.
The media is placed next to the text to make the page more attractive to look at whilst also giving examples of some of the work the company has completed themselves and some of the work 3rd parties have completed.

##Gallery
Each section within the gallery has a header, followed by a scrollable container that includes as many of the images as available. I have seperated the images into sections so the user can find the relevent section straight away. This was someone looking to have new doors won't have to look through loads of roofing pictures.

##Get In Touch
This page is the form used to get in contact with the company and to request a quote. There is an initial sentence telling the user that any field marked with an asterisk is required, which matches up with the 'required' attribute on the corresponding element.

###Personal Details
This section of the form is to gather all the information about the customer, like their name and contact details, so the company knows who is contacting them.

-The title and gender inputs are drop down lists so as to make it easier for the user.
-The phone input is set to only recieve a integers as apposed to any letters or text.
-The email input is set to recognise an e-mail.
-All other inputs are set to recieve text.

###Address Details
This section is made up of text inputs for each line of your address. This is to keep all the information under the same field set so it's easier for the company to read after recieving the form.

###Services needed
This section is used to recieve all the information the company requires to get an idea of what work the customer is asking for. I have used radio buttons for the type of work required as it enables the company to sort the jobs easier. This will give an indication on how big the job is, as a lot of the time in the construction industry repair jobs are fairly small but new additions take a bit longer.

###Submit/Reset
These buttons are large to be obvious to the user what they do and where they are on the page.

##Features left to implement
All the image containers would be replaced with a gallery that automatically changes every 5 seconds and has arrows to click to create a slideshow effect. This is after further studying javascript.

#Testing
When testing I used the inspect tool on Google Chrome to test how this looks on different screen sizes and used this to adjust details in the media queries. This was to ensure the website looks good across all devices.

When testing I made sure to check that the features change layout as they are supposed to when using smaller media screens and that everything still looks and works as it should.

I checked the colors worked well with eachother on https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/.

All the bugs have been recorded in the bugs.txt file. [bugs](/bugs.txt)
