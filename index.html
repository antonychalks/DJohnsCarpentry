            <h2>Who are we?</h2>
            <p>Scott and Antony are the lead Carpenters here at SNA Carpentry. After meeting in the military, and doing
                carpentry in different countries around the world, we decided to use the expertise and problem-solving
                we learnt to build our own carpentry company, and have since successfully completed multiple jobs
                to a high standard.</p>
            <h2>What do we do?</h2>
            <p>We have a wide range of carpentry skills between us, including kitchen fitting, hanging doors, bespoke
                media walls and much more. We won't take on any jobs we don't believe we can complete to a high standard
                so feel free to get in touch and we'll see how we can help.</p>
            <h2>Why choose us?</h2>
            <p>Here at SNA Carpentry we don't only have high standards set for ourselves in terms of our work output, we
                think it's equally as important you ensure the customer has as easy and pleasant of an experience as
                possible. We will turn up on time, we won't lie to you, and we are highly reliable.</p>
